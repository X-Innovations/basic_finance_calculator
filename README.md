# Basic Auto Finance Quote

Your task is to build a small application that calculates and manages auto loan quotes.  

This project is intentionally open-ended. We want to see the technical and architectural choices you make rather than following a step-by-step guide.

## Design Reference

We’ve provided this design as a general reference for layout and functionality.  
You don’t need to match it pixel-for-pixel — use it as guidance for the structure and flow of the app.

## Requirements

- **Frontend**: Use Vue with TypeScript  
- **Backend**: Use TypeScript (framework and storage are your choice)  
- **Functionality**:
  - A form for entering finance quote inputs (cost, profit, selling price, term, rate, tax rate, out-of-pocket, etc.)  
  - Selling price, cost, and profit should stay consistent (changing one affects the others).  
  - A way to calculate the quote and display the results (monthly payment, taxes, loan amount, etc.).  
  - Ability to save quotes and delete quotes, persisted to a backend.  
  - A list of saved quotes with basic details and actions to view or delete them.  

## What We’re Looking For

- Correct implementation of finance calculations  
- Clean TypeScript code across frontend and backend  
- Sensible choices in data modeling, validation, and state management  
- Usable and reasonably styled UI  
- Clear instructions for running the project locally  

## Expectations

- Keep it simple, but make it functional.  
- Show us how you structure and organize code.  
- Document any trade-offs or shortcuts you take.  
- Tests are welcome, but not required.  

## Submission

1. Fork this repo.  
2. Build your project in your fork.  
3. Update this README with any notes you want us to know.  
4. Share your fork when finished.  

This project should take a few hours, not days. Focus on demonstrating your skills, not building a production-ready system.
